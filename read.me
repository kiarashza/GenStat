# GenStat
## code overview
The file "GlobalPrespective.py" includes the training pipeline as well as the implementation of  the objective function. Source codes for loading the real and synthetic graphs are included in "data.py". "DataSetSamples" contains a visualization of randomly selected samples for each dataset.  
"data/LDP/" contains the perturbed adjacency matrices used for graph generation with LDP guarantee. All the Python packages used in our experiments are provided in "requirement.yml".
Generated graph samples for GenStat are provided in the "ReportedResult/" directory, both in the pickle and png format.  Generated samples by the deep GGMs can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mF-kU021-ceNh6ejLgf41sSE9FEzc01Q).
We used "GraphGenerationWithLDP.py" and "GraphGeneration.py" for the GenStat's reported result in the Sec. 4. These files contain the necessary commands and hyperparameters used in the experiments.
## GenStat Training
The image below showcases a randomly selected generated sample from the model's snapshot, trained on the lobster dataset, at a specific epoch.
